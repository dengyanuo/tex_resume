I am not familiar with Michigan... Especially with living conditions. But it is cold though.

However, few things to keep in mind:

A) there are different neighbourhoods within a city/area, so one can find relatively "safe" places... But all places have risks and rewards.. God's grace and protection keeps us.

B) I doubt Omni will set up in an unsafe place?

C) when is your family coming over? Here already? Maybe consider moving alone there first to check out?

D) it may be your wife that decides etc, but no need to be so transparent in your communication ... Easily misunderstood and used against you. Just say what you want in the least amount of words with the least explanations in a professional environment.

E) check if this is a 3-4 mtg job... If they have hired someone already, and want to hire you, will they replace you when the other guy is ready? Or will they drip the other guy after hiring him before he even come on board? Seems like a very strange hiring behavior

F) regardless, one way to consider this, it is a small step to get hired into the industry. Once you have a US company job experience, the next opportunity may be slightly easier? So within reasons, consider first, get the offer, then decide if you want it or not?
