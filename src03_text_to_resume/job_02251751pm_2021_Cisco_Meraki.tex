I'm currently working on behalf of 
\filltospace{6em}{
Cisco Meraki 
} 
for several roles and your profile came across one of my searches. 
They are the world's largest Cloud Networking Services 
and it seems as though they could use your talents.

What they offer:

- Fully remote now and in the future (they are located in San Francisco)

- Base + Equity + Bonus

- Fully medical, dental, and vision insurance

- 401k option Plan

What they need:

- Proficiency in C / C++

- Experience in a Linux environment
