</span>Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ,
<sup>(
)
 \par 
<span>To God’s elect,
<sup>(
)
</sup> exiles
<sup>(
)
</sup> scattered
<sup>(
)
</sup> throughout the provinces of Pontus,
<sup>(
)
</sup> Galatia,
<sup>(
)
</sup> Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia,
<sup>(
)
<sup>2 
</sup>who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge
<sup>(
)
</sup> of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit,
<sup>(
)
</sup> to be obedient
<sup>(
)
</sup> to Jesus Christ and sprinkled with his blood:
<sup>(
)
 \par 
<span>Grace and peace be yours in abundance.
<sup>(
)
 \par 
<span>Praise to God for a Living Hope
 \par 
<sup>3 
</sup>Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ!
<sup>(
)
</sup> In his great mercy
<sup>(
)
</sup> he has given us new birth
<sup>(
)
</sup> into a living hope
<sup>(
)
</sup> through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
<sup>(
)
<sup>4 
</sup>and into an inheritance
<sup>(
)
</sup> that can never perish, spoil or fade.
<sup>(
)
</sup> This inheritance is kept in heaven for you,
<sup>(
)
<sup>5 
</sup>who through faith are shielded by God’s power
<sup>(
)
</sup> until the coming of the salvation
<sup>(
)
</sup> that is ready to be revealed
<sup>(
)
</sup> in the last time.
<sup>6 
</sup>In all this you greatly rejoice,
<sup>(
)
</sup> though now for a little while
<sup>(
)
</sup> you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials.
<sup>(
)
<sup>7 
</sup>These have come so that the proven genuineness
<sup>(
)
</sup> of your faith—of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire
<sup>(
)
</sup>—may result in praise, glory and honor
<sup>(
)
</sup> when Jesus Christ is revealed.
<sup>(
)
<sup>8 
</sup>Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him
<sup>(
)
</sup> and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy,
<sup>9 
</sup>for you are receiving the end result of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
<sup>(
)
 \par 
<sup>10 
</sup>Concerning this salvation, the prophets, who spoke
<sup>(
)
</sup> of the grace that was to come to you,
<sup>(
)
</sup> searched intently and with the greatest care,
<sup>(
)
<sup>11 
</sup>trying to find out the time and circumstances to which the Spirit of Christ
<sup>(
)
</sup> in them was pointing when he predicted
<sup>(
)
</sup> the sufferings of the Messiah and the glories that would follow.
<sup>12 
</sup>It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you,
<sup>(
)
</sup> when they spoke of the things that have now been told you by those who have preached the gospel to you
<sup>(
)
</sup> by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven.
<sup>(
)
</sup> Even angels long to look into these things.
 \par 
<span>Be Holy
 \par 
<sup>13 
</sup>Therefore, with minds that are alert and fully sober,
<sup>(
)
</sup> set your hope
<sup>(
)
</sup> on the grace to be brought to you
<sup>(
)
</sup> when Jesus Christ is revealed at his coming.
<sup>(
)
<sup>14 
</sup>As obedient
<sup>(
)
</sup> children, do not conform
<sup>(
)
</sup> to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance.
<sup>(
)
<sup>15 
</sup>But just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do;
<sup>(
)
<sup>16 
</sup>for it is written: “Be holy, because I am holy.”
<sup>[
]
<sup>(
)
 \par 
<sup>17 
</sup>Since you call on a Father
<sup>(
)
</sup> who judges each person’s work
<sup>(
)
</sup> impartially,
<sup>(
)
</sup> live out your time as foreigners
<sup>(
)
</sup> here in reverent fear.
<sup>(
)
<sup>18 
</sup>For you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed
<sup>(
)
</sup> from the empty way of life
<sup>(
)
</sup> handed down to you from your ancestors,
<sup>19 
</sup>but with the precious blood
<sup>(
)
</sup> of Christ, a lamb
<sup>(
)
</sup> without blemish or defect.
<sup>(
)
<sup>20 
</sup>He was chosen before the creation of the world,
<sup>(
)
</sup> but was revealed in these last times
<sup>(
)
</sup> for your sake.
<sup>21 
</sup>Through him you believe in God,
<sup>(
)
</sup> who raised him from the dead
<sup>(
)
</sup> and glorified him,
<sup>(
)
</sup> and so your faith and hope
<sup>(
)
</sup> are in God.
 \par 
<sup>22 
</sup>Now that you have purified
<sup>(
)
</sup> yourselves by obeying
<sup>(
)
</sup> the truth so that you have sincere love for each other, love one another deeply,
<sup>(
)
</sup> from the heart.
<sup>[
]
<sup>23 
</sup>For you have been born again,
<sup>(
)
</sup> not of perishable seed, but of imperishable,
<sup>(
)
</sup> through the living and enduring word of God.
<sup>(
)
<sup>24 
</sup>For,
 \par 
<span>“All people are like grass,
 \par 
<span>and all their glory is like the flowers of the field;
 \par 
<span>the grass withers and the flowers fall,
 \par 
<sup>25 
</span>but the word of the Lord endures forever.”
<sup>[
]
<sup>(
)
 \par 
<span>And this is the word that was preached to you.
