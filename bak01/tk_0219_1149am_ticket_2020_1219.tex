I am Yanuo Deng. 

I was found guilty on the traffic court this morning. 

I was a refugee. The USCIS approved my work permit. But because covid-19, nobody knows when I will get the real EAD card. So until now, my income is zero. 

I have been homeless before I came to Yuba county. Thanks to God, Pastor Arsenia let me stay at her home. I got food from the food bank. And I have to ask help from Arsenia, for the gasoline. So, it's difficult for me to pay the ticket now.

After the court this morning, I went to the first level and asked help from the staff. 
She gave me a form and I filled and selected `` reduce the fee ''. 
When I came back home, Arsenia told me that `` You should select to work for the work project ''.

So, could you forgive my mistake and let me select to work for the work project ?
